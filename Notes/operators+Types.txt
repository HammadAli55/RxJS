RxJS
Used to manage obervers and observables 

RxJS imports function called operators in order to achieve delcarative programming.
RxJS operators facilitate us to change the original observable in some manner and return 
a new observable. The operators do not change the existing observable.

Operators: Help us control obervables stream of data types:
1. Creation Operators (create new observables)
2. Pipeable Operators (takes an observable as an input and outputs a new observable)
